		  <p> Firstly, this game came out in 2018, and was on its last legs and the creators were planning on letting it die and move on to the game’s sequel, but recently it blown up, thanks to youtubers playing it. I feel the main reason that this game blew up is mainly because of the quarantine, and many people want games where they can play with their friends, and with the deception, it can be really entertaining for the viewers, but is it fun to be one of the players or is it better to be an observer? </p>
		  <p>&nbsp;Since there is no story to this game, I will be skipping over this section.</p>
		  <p>The gameplay is simple, depending on the room 4-10 players and you are placed into one of to teams the crewmates and the imposters. The job of the crewmates is to either complete all their takes, or the other way for them to win is by voting on who the killer is and killing them. For the Imposters, their mission is to kill of enough of the crewmates so that the imposter/s cannot be voted off or sabotage a piece of the ship, and if the crewmates don’t fix it in time, then the imposters win. When someone has been killed both the imposters and crewmates can report the body, which will pull all the players into a meeting, from here the players need to investigate each other and vote on who they think the imposter is, and it’s up to the imposters to convince the other players that they are not the imposter. As an imposter you get some tools to help you kill the crewmates, you can use vents which allows you to move around the map quickly, but if a crewmate sees you then you’re in trouble, and you can sabotage parts of the map, such as the doors locking and sabotaging parts of the map, there are usually three things you can sabotage, one is the lights, which greatly reduces the view distance of the crewmates, making it easier for the imposter to vent and kill the crewmates.</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;I would have to say, if you want to get the most enjoyment out of this game, then play it with friends, in voice chat if possible, as playing with randoms doesn’t go well, this is because a lot of the time people are playing this game with their friends, so most of the time you’ll either be kicked from the game immediately or they won’t see what you’re putting in the in-game chat, so if you can I recommend that you play this game with friends, it’s free on mobile devices, you just have to sit through an ad after each game, or you can get it on Steam for a small fee, and luckily this game has cross-play so mobile and PC users can play together.</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;For the sound design, there’s not to no music, other than the music that plays when an imposter kills you and the main menu theme, both songs are nice not anything I would listen to willingly but still good, the sound effects are nice nothing that will get on your nerves, but when running around the map, with nothing but the sound of your own foot steps being the only thing you can hear really helps build an atmosphere, of isolation, and when you see another player and you don’t know if they’re an imposter or not, can be very scary.</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;Overall, this is a good fun game to play with friends, not too much to it, but a game like this doesn’t need much to be enjoyable, the enjoyment mainly comes from how, everyone acts around each other, people accusing each other, and being scared whenever two players come across each other in the game. This game is easy to get on mobile with it being free or can be purchased from the steam store, and mobile and PC users can play together, the music is fine for what it is but the best part of the sound design is the lack of music while in-game, with nothing but the sound of your own feet, to fill the empty space. This game really makes you think to try and figure out who the imposters are, just the only problem with playing this game is being the first one dead you’re really just left out of playing the main part of the game which is debating on who the imposters are.</p>
