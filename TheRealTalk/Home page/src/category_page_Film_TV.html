		    The Mandalorian&nbsp; </h2>
			<p>
			  So, Star Wars hasn’t been doing too well, people don’t like the new main character Rey, people aren’t watching the films, Star Wars Solo no one went to watch and, with EA owning the gaming rights to Star Wars and only Star Wars fallen Order was the only successful Star Wars game. Many people have not been very impressed with how Disney has been handling the Star Wars Franchise, they really needed a show that people would enjoy, and I feel that The Mandalorian is at least a step in the right direction.

			  Video Games. A Great sauce of entertainment, from the NES era of gaming where many of the games were about a lives system, but there were also those few games that tried telling an a story even with the limitations, and as time went on games started having bigger and bigger stories the JRPGs of the Super Nintendo era, the first 3D action games of the late 90s all the way to now where people have started claiming video games as works of art for trying to push boundaries and telling amazing and interesting stories.

			  The Rising of the Shield Hero

			<p> Warning: This series contains, material that may be upsetting to some viewers. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;The rising of the shield hero is a series, that makes a slight change to the usual groundwork of an Isakai (a series where the main character is sent to another world, by magic or through reincarnation. The world is usually a Medieval Fantasy world.), usually our main character would be accepted into this new world with open arms, but this series decides to change it up slightly.</p>

			  Dragon’s Dogma Anime
			</h2>
			<p>
			  When I first heard about the game Dragon’s dogma is getting it’s own animated series, I expected it to follow the game’s story, and for it to explain a lot about it’s world and how it works, but instead it ended up being entirely different from the story told in the game, which I’m fine with, I just would of liked to of been able to understand more of the world, and it’s laws that govern it.

			<h2>
			  High Score
			</h2>
			<p>
			  Video Games. One of if not the largest media industry in the world, with a deep and interesting history, from the first video game made, and the rise and fall of the video game market, before it’s inevitable rise from the ashes. The history of video games is an important one as it can help teach us how this past time has been able to do things like bridge gaps between age and race, give people hope in an otherwise sad situation, or even inspire people to push beyond what others had done with the before. I feel that the Netflix documentary High Score dose an amazing job at telling people about the history of videos games, even if it does tend to jump around a bit on its topics.

			<h2>
		    Hi-Score Girl&nbsp; </h2>
			<p>
			  I’ve recently finished this anime on Netflix that goes by the name Hi-Score Girl. Hi-Score girl is an anime that has recently received it’s second season and is adapted from the original manga (A Japanese comic that reads from right to left even for the translation and typically do not colour in their panels) of the same name The thing that first pulled me in was the setting, the anime begins place in 1991 up to the late-90s , around the time arcades were really starting to take off, thanks largely in part to 2D fighting game, the story follows a young gamer growing up during this time named, Haruo Yaguchi as he forms an uncanny rivalry with the most popular girl in his class Akira Ono, who keeps her gaming habits secret, as time passes new characters get introduced such as secondary girl Koharu Hidaka.
