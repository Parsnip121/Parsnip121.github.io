		  <p> With Dragon Marked for Death or DMFD, the game is split in to two versions on the switch, the frontline fighters which contains the Empress and Warrior and technical attackers which contains the Shinobi and Witch, and with the recent 3.0 update added two new characters the Bandit which is playable after beating the DLC and the Oracle which is playable after beating the game once, as I have only played as the Empress, Warrior, Oracle and Bandit This review will be about these characters. </p>
		  <p>The Story of DMFD takes place years after a battle between the celestials and the Astral Dragons till the strongest of the Astral Dragons Atruum was defeated leading to the victory for the Celestials, but this is never really talked about as the game itself takes places eons later. You play as a member of the DragonBlood clan a clan of humans who were saved by the fallen Astral Dragon Atruum by offering his blood to the clan of humans, this gave the humans powers tied to a part of the Astral Dragon.</p>
		  <p>None of that really matters as the main story focuses on one of the playable characters who is the only survivor from your village, who must now use the powers of the Astra Dragon to get revenge and save the DragonBlood Clan’s Oracle, and that’s the story, it mainly takes a back seat to the gameplay till the end, which is fine for this type of game. There is a DLC story line following the Bandit character whose story is a bit more involved than the base game story line but yet again the story isn’t the main focus for a game like this.</p>
		  <p>The main focus of DMFD is the missions, the missions are set up like they would be in Monster Hunter you go to the quest board where in DMFD it’s the tavern you select your mission and then you’re sent to the location the mission takes place in, all of the missions are timed but that never became a problem throughout my entire time playing, as the timer’s very forgiving even for the post-game mission Cave of torment which gives you an extra 15 minutes</p>
		  <p>As for the gameplay, DMFD is a 2D action platformer with RPG elements, you earn EXP from killing enemies and for completing quests but the EXP gained will only be applied once the mission is completed. The characters’ movements are smooth and responsive allowing for quick sudden inputs.</p>
		  <p>In late and post-game it dose get to a point where monsters will start killing the player characters in one hit, forcing you to use items that prevent insta-death hits, but this isn’t as bad as it sounds as it is possible to dodge the attacks of all the monsters and in the terms of the warrior he can shield the hits.</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;The game is very nice to control, the input is very responsive which it would have to be for a game like this, the characters’ movements are smoothly animated. The story is mostly absent for a good part of the game only really coming back to the forefront at specific points but even then, it still feels very absent, unless it’s the DLC story which is a bit more prevalent that the base game story. The gameplay is nice the difficulty isn’t too high and grinding isn’t too necessary till the mid-point of the game, and the controls are nice and responsive making the game a joy to play.</p>
		  <p>Update: since this review was written, there has been two new characters added, the Bandit and the Orical, both feel like a combination of two of the already exsiting character, the Bandit feels like a combination of Empress and Shinobi and the orical feels like a combination of the Warrior and whitch. Along with two added characters, the game also adds a new weapon class for the warrio, empress, and whitch (the shinobi didn't get a new weapon type as they already have 2, and the game can now only be purchised as a whole game, meaning that if you own one half of the game you will need to buy the full game to get the other two characte, this is a move I'm not a fan o, but if you don't own the game at all the, this change won't affect you.</p>
