			<h2>
		    Berserk&nbsp;&nbsp; </h2>
			<p> Warning: The berserk series is intended for an 18+ audience, if you are under the age of 18, I ask that you do not continue reading this review. Berserk also has scenes of sexual assault and extreme violence, reader discretion is advised. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;Berserk is a long running manga series written by a man called Kentaro Miura, and at the time of writing there are 40 volumes, this story dose get new chapters very slowly, there is no definitive reason for why Miura has&nbsp;slowed in his release of chapters, but many fans of berserk likes to say it’s because of Miura’s addiction to the video game Idol Master, there’s no evidence to support this other than Miura himself has admitted, that he is a big fan of the series. Even with the constant hiatuses, this series may still be worth your time, and I hope to convince you it is.</p>

			<h2>
		    Abyss Rage&nbsp; </h2>
			<p>I've just recently started using Shonun jump’s new website where you can read many of their catalog for free, called Manga Plus. Now Jump doesn’t have every single chapter for their all their manga, but one of the mangas they had was Abyss rage. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;The story for abyss rage, is rather simple, a blind boy named Shinobu, is training to me a martial artist before his girlfriend Mikoto is taken away from him by a stranger that beat his adopted father and himself in a fight. Three years later Shinobu is taken to a prison island where he must fight and kill other prisoners to gain enough points to be let out and save Mikoto. The story was very basic, it wasn’t by any means bad, but ok. That’s pretty much how I can describe, the story never really jumped out at me, I mainly kept reading, because I wanted to know hoe the story end. Once I did finish it, I really couldn’t think of how I felt after reading. I don’t hate the series but I also can’t say I liked it, making this very hard for me to write.</p>
