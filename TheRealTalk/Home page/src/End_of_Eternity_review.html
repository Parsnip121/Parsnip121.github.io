		    Resonance of fate/End of Eternity review&nbsp;&nbsp; </h3>
			<img alt="Bootstrap Image Preview" src="../../../images/banners/Game/Resonance of Fate 4K HD Edition banner.png" width="1040">			
		  <p> The Steam Summer Sale has come and gone and I was able to get myself a couple of games one of which I have already reviewed, Doom Eternal, this time, which is clear from the title is a game called resonance of fate/End of eternity. I don’t know too much about this game it was something that stood out when compared to many other JRPGs, with it’s more muted colour scheme, the fact that it’s focus is more on guns that swords and magic, and lastly is the world which looks like a steam-punk world, and finally the combat which looked to be more cinematic and not using the turn based system, which I really liked the look of. </p>
		  <p>For the graphics and over visuals of the game they look very good, even though this game did originally come out for the PS3 and Xbox360 the updated graphics look really nice making it hard to tell it even originally came out for those consoles. The visuals of the world are striking, everywhere you look there are gears moving keeping this world turning, on the world map you can see there’s land beyond the clockwork world you inhabit for the entire game. The designs of the characters are nothing too outstanding, they’re good for the role they are needed for, all the designs fit the world, except for a character called Pater, when I first saw his design I need to take a second to take in his design, it’s the most “unique” out of all the characters that appear in the game. The enemies you fight very from mobsters to large mobsters, imp looking creatures that hide in barrels, plan engines cases, treasure chests, and barrels with rubbish on it (this gives that version mor armor). There’s mechs walking around, a creature that looks like a two-legged elephant, a yeti with what looks to be cubes of iron in its fur and more that I can’t remember right now.</p>
		  <p>The Gameplay. This is going to be the longest part as there is a lot to go over. First off there are two types of damage an enemy can take scratch damage which turns a character’s bar from green to blue and can’t be used to kill, and Direct Damage which turns all accumulated scratch damage in to direct damage. Scratch damage can only be dealt by submachineguns and direct damage can only be inflicted by handguns, handguns do barely any damage to an enemy so if you want to do any rea damage you’ll need to first use a submachinegun and then hit them with a handgun to do real damage. In the game there are only three types of weapons your characters can use, handguns, submachineguns and throwables, each have their own level tied to them and getting a character to use a specific type of weapon to do damage will give EXP for the class, and once a class levels up the character goes up a level. Leveling in the game only gives there character more health a higher weight capacity, and occasionally an upgrade to a class’ skill. For each level gained in a class gives your character the ability to charge your weapons increase by 1. Depending of the weapon you are using will dictate what the charging effect it, submachineguns increase their power for each level of charge, this is because the game expects you to do scratch damage before do direct damage to kill an enemy.</p>
		  <p>Handguns build up gauge break, this segments the enemies’ health bar in to fractions and once the health is depleted past that point the player gets back a point in their hero gauge, which allows the player to do running attack, attacks that allows the player to move a character around the arena, and as long as you have at least one point in your hero gauge all damage the player characters get is scratch damage and once a characters health bar is fully scratch damage, they fill be knocked down spending some of the hero gauge and being fully healed while scattering parts of the gauge lowering the total amount of points that can be held until either the fight ends or the player picks up all the pieces. The enemies can also gather up the pieces and heal from then, plus they will hold on to the pieces until you break their gauge or kill the enemy. There’s the throwables which charge effect allows for knocking the enemy up in to the air easier.</p>
		  <p>The most important thing is that there are very few guns in the game, from my research there appears to be only 15 guns total, as getting new guns is not the main way of getting stronger, the only way to get a stronger gun is by adding attachments to them. It dose get to the point where the attachments do not make sense but as long as all the attachments circles with shapes cut out of them get filled in you can place it anywhere, and these either add more bullets to a gun’s clip, increase charge speed, increase charge acceleration, increase accuracy, and rate of fire.</p>
		  <p>There are more mechanics but I think I covered the most important stuff and if I was to keep going then I might end up repeating myself, there is a tutorial at the arena which can be accessed at the start of the game from the world map it did a good job at explain the games mechanics. Next on to the story. Oh boy the story, I could not tell you what the story is about, infect even the resonance of fate community would have trouble explaining it, the story is pretty disconnected for almost the entire story you have your three main characters, Zephyr your typical edgy boy, Leanne a girl with a mysterious past and Vachyron, he’s like the boss/mentor. They’re guns for hire and the story follows as they do jobs for different individuals, and at the end of each chapter you see a man mourning the death of his wife while wanting to take control of a machine god called Zenith. Zenith is a machine which I believe gives humans immortality and ties their lives to a specific piece of quartz which when broke will kill that person instantly, someone can still be killed even without the breaking of their quartz from any other course of death. The character of Leanne is meant to be the character from the game’s opening cinematic that plays after hitting new game but the game never tells you this till much later in the game plus it never tells the player how both Leanne and Zephyr survive a couple thousand feet fall.</p>
		  <p>The story is the worst thing ever I know I explained a part of the story but that is the most surface level of what this story is about, I could not tell you what happens later on in the story or how the player’s party cross paths with the man planning to control Zenith, none of it made sense, it feel like they were rushed to finishing the story it feels that forced, I don’t even know why I was fighting the villains, even when I got to the final boss I had no idea it was even the final boss, and once defeated if you save the game over your main save slot then you can’t go back and explore the world before the final boss fight, like with most JRPGs plus completing the games is what allows you to access harder difficulties but that can only be accessed from a completed save and picking the option to do a harder difficulty doesn’t give you any of the items you gathered throughout your playthrough, I don’t know if it instantly overwrites the save file as I was still very annoyed about the ending which makes just as much sense as the rest of the game.</p>
		  <p>The side mission of the game aren’t very rewarding I was making sure to complete each and every side mission I could, but there came a point where if it wasn’t an attachment, then I ended up ignoring it, and if you advance the story to the next chapter any uncompleted mission become impossible to complete for the rest of the game for the rest of the game. I was given bonus items for reaching a certain number of starts for completing side mission but it was mainly items I could get from fighting.</p>
		  <p>The sound design is nice I enjoyed many of the game’s battle music during boss fights and regular fights, plus the world map’s theme was fine, luckily it didn’t get on my nerves, as you do spend 90% of the game in the world map so the music had better be good, I can’t go in to too much detail with the music as nothing really stood out and I’m not the best at critiquing music yet. The gun’s and throwables sound effects sounded nice and fit the type of gun being used, the voices were in sync with the characters lips but there were times where the characters were talking but the characters’ moths weren’t moving, and since there was no effect used on the voices at this time it was hard to tell if they were monologuing or not. There was one case in a single cutscene where a character did cut them self-off and the two characters in this scene do overlap a fare bit making it hard to understand what each is saying.</p>
		  <p>Over all the game was fun to the play battle system is something I had not seen done before even if there is a lot to take in, some of the boss fights and some of the special monster fights did feel very unfair especially when the enemy can freeze your character almost 100% of the time, and the gun modifications was nice but the only real way of putting damage of an enemy being turning scratch damage in to direct damage made me feel like I wasn’t advancing much in the game at all as I was doing the same thing from beginning to end, which made it all feel stagnated. The characters are enjoyable especially Vashyron his English voice actor’s delivery really helps the jokes that much better, the main villain’s motivations made no sense, all I could understand is that he wanted to control god and he lost his faith and did some experimenting which is never mentioned to the player what that experiment was meant to be for. The chemistry between the characters was enjoyable the jokes never felt out of place and I did crack up at a couple of the victory lines. Overall, I can recommend the game on its unique gameplay and interesting even if it is a lot to take in all at once but the tutorial at the game’s arena did a good job at teaching me and the fact that it’s optional was nice allowing those experienced with the game get in to it faster, how the main characters mesh is enjoyable and the main reason I kept playing, but the game’s story as a whole is not a very good reason to play the game as there isn’t much of one to speak of and what story is there makes no sense and the characters motivations make no sense, I even tried looking up videos on YouTube hoping to find a YouTuber that could explain the story to me but at the time of writing I could not find one. The game was fun but I never felt like I improved as I used the same strategy from beginning to end, and other than the characters’ chemistry there wasn’t any reason to continue in the story, so I don’t feel confident in recommending this game to anyone which is a real shame as there is something better hidden in the game but it just never gets realized.</p>
