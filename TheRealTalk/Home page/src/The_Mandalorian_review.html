		    The Mandalorian&nbsp;&nbsp; </h3>

		  <p> So, Star Wars hasn’t been doing too well, people don’t like the new main character Rey, people aren’t watching the films, Star Wars Solo no one went to watch and, with EA owning the gaming rights to Star Wars and only Star Wars fallen Order was the only successful Star Wars game. Many people have not been very impressed with how Disney has been handling the Star Wars Franchise, they really needed a show that people would enjoy, and I feel that The Mandalorian is at least a step in the right direction. </p>
		  <p>The plot for The Mandalorian follows the Main character who everyone refers to as some variation of Mandalorian usually using Mando. The story takes place in between episodes 6 and 7 after the defeat of the empire there are still small factions that remain trying to reclaim their power. Mando is a bounty hunter, and when he’s sent out on one mission to collect the target alive, discovering that t5he target was actually a baby he decides to go in to hiding with it in order to protect them, and the main portion of the story is Mando traveling around. We get to learn a bit about Mando little by little with each episode.</p>
		  <p>With the sound design, if you have any idea what Star Wars should sound like then nothing will feel out of place here the blaster sound like blasters, the one AT-AT you see sounds like it died in the movies. None of the sounds overpower any of the characters, and the balancing of the sounds is good, the speeder bikes sound like speeder bikes, the only thing I feel doesn’t fit the feel of star Wars is the music, specifically the opening and ending themes they just don’t feel like Star Wars songs, I can’t picture hearing them alongside other songs from Star Wars.</p>
		  <p>As the for the Actors, each of them play their roles very well Mando, being a strong and silent character, and the fact we never see his face adds to his character, the gang you meet in one mission felt a bit too two dimensional in their acting and their characters, they just felt like people that had a chance to be bad so they do every bad thing possible regardless of if it negatively effects them. This makes them appear more stupid than anything and very unlikeable and not in the good story writing way, but it dose have one of the best, parts in the whole series where Mando, takes on the role of a hunter and the episode turns in to a little bit of horror. Many of the other characters are very likeable characters the guild master, dose feel a little wishy-washy in where he stands on in the story, he makes a pretty big jump from one side to the other, which is meant to be shocking but comes off a little forced.</p>
		  <p>The commando Woman fits her role very well and feels very believable I can easily picture her fighting in a war, the only draw back is when she gets in to a fist fight with Mando, she punches his helmet which is strong enough to deflect blaster bolts, but this is more down to the script and less her character. Finally, the baby which many have referred to as baby Yoda, this character is made more for comic relief and the way it’s used is very smart, and doesn’t break the tension of scenes. The fact that the baby is a puppet instead of it being a CGI model allows for the characters to interact with it better as the puppet actually takes up physical space, so no one has to awkwardly mime holding it.</p>
		  <p>To summaries The Mandalorian is a good step in the writ direction when compared to the new Star Wars trilogy, the story is better paced there is no lore breaking, the characters are believable in both their acting and their abilities, none of the side characters are terrible, just some feel a little flat in the way they’re written. The sound design is great, it sounds like Star Wars, as in the sound effects come across as effects that could easily be heard in the older star wars shows and films and not feel out of place, the Music is very fitting except the opening and ending they do feel a little of when compared to the rest of the Star Wars soundtrack which could be seen as a positive as it makes the themes more recognizable and, can be easily connected back to the Mandalorian.</p>
