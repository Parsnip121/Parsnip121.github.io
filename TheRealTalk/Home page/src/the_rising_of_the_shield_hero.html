		    The Rising of the Shield Hero&nbsp;&nbsp; </h3>

		  <p> Warning: This series contains, material that may be upsetting to some viewers. </p>
		  <p>The rising of the shield hero is a series, that makes a slight change to the usual groundwork of an Isakai (a series where the main character is sent to another world, by magic or through reincarnation. The world is usually a Medieval Fantasy world.), usually our main character would be accepted into this new world with open arms, but this series decides to change it up slightly.</p>
		  <p>The story begins with our main character Naofumi Iwatani, we learn a little about his life on earth before being sent to another world. As soon as Naofumi gets to this new world he’s accompanied by 3 other characters and together they are the 4 cardinal heroes. The 3 other heroes are Motoyasu Kitamura the spear hero, Ren amaki the sword hero and Itsuki Kawasumi the bow hero.</p>
		  <p>from the off set it’s clear that our main character is working with a handicap, and it’s not long till our main character has everything taken from him. Now this is the part of episode 1 that is talked about so much the false rape accusation, this one moment has caused so much hate around the show, with people saying the creator is trying to undermine the metoo movement.</p>
		  <p>The moment that Naofumi got accused was a necessary way to get him to hit rock bottom, and I never really saw a problem with it, false accusations are made in the real world just not that often, and this is something that dose stick even in the real and it’s brought up whenever the other heroes see Naofumi. I was really pulled into this story because Naofumi, didn’t do what most main characters of the isekai series do and stay positive no, Naofumi actually turns into a bit of an ass whole, but he has to because he needs to get stronger to fight things called waves, which are events that happen in this world where monsters appear from cracks in the sky and attack the inhabitants of the world, and it’s up to the heroes to fight them off. With Naofumi being left with nothing means that he must do everything in his power to get as strong as possible, eve if that means he has to be ruthless sometimes to people around him, never enough to be seen as a full blown bad guy but just enough to be considered an anti-hero or a true neutral person. I forgot to mention that since Naofumi is the shield hero, he can’t attack very well and because of the rules of the legendary shield he’s not allowed to use any other weapon, meaning that he struggles to fight monsters and needs others to do the damage for him.</p>
		  <p>The animation is very nicely done throughout the series, the colors are well utilized, the way the colours tones are used to help amplify the scenes. The animation is all smooth and makes the fight scenes enjoyable to watch, the character designs I really liked, I liked how each of the heroes have a colour palette specific to them. I thought the designs of Naofumi’s companies were nice and, allows the show to have more it’s own identity, as just by looking at the character’s designs I can tell what show they’re from.</p>
		  <p>Now I watched this series in English because I have a hard time keeping up with the Japanese dub’s subtitles. With that being said I really liked the voice actors, they each played their roles well Naofumi I really like, because of the emotions he puts into his world it feels very realistic to what the characters would be talking like in that situation. The sound quality was good, and the effect done when Naofumi is being taken over by the rage shield for the first time I liked as everything looks like a video and the rage shield seems to go against the rules of the shield, so a glitchy static effect was very fitting. The music for both openings for shield hero I liked, they were catchy and made me watch the openings every time.</p>
		  <p>Overall, I really liked the anime for shield hero, as I like the idea of a character who falls from grace, and to see it affect him, and change how he behaves in the story. I enjoyed how the characters interacted with each other, the progression of the story and how the false accusation plot line is resolved. The music was nice to listen too especially opening 1 and opening 2. I loved the look of the show, it allowed it to have more of it’s own identity, making it stand out more in a market that’s become over saturated as of recently with all the isekais out there. The work of the English cast was good they really fit their characters, and I feel they did a good job playing their characters as well. There were points in the story that I felt could have been done differently, which would of helped the story, but even with one or two points, I still enjoyed the overall show and look forward to season 2 and season 3 of shield hero.</p>
