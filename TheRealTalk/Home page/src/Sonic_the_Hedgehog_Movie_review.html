		    Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;&nbsp; </h3>

		  <p> Video Games. A Great sauce of entertainment, from the NES era of gaming where many of the games were about a lives system, but there were also those few games that tried telling an a story even with the limitations, and as time went on games started having bigger and bigger stories the JRPGs of the Super Nintendo era, the first 3D action games of the late 90s all the way to now where people have started claiming video games as works of art for trying to push boundaries and telling amazing and interesting stories. </p>
		  <p>What is the story for Sonic the Hedgehog? Well it follows sonic living on earth in hiding as he, has a very special power which allows him to run as fast as he doses. This power is never explained it’s just something he has, so using rings sonic is forced to leave his home and his carer behind and hide on earth in the town of Green Hill. Sonic messes up and thanks to his power made a small EMP effect go off affecting a large area and now he’s on the run from people, being led by Dr. EggMan, this forces Sonic to have to flee to another planet. Before Sonic can escape, he is then found by the other main character, Tom Wachowski, a police officer who plans on moving into the city to pursue his dream of saving people who are in danger, he shoots sonic with a tranquilizer. The story is pretty bad all of the events of the film is because Sonic is sad being alone and wants a friend. The message of this film is terrible because it’s just don’t pursue your dream and just stay where you are, but since the film needs to make this a good thing they make Tom agree with it and give-up on his because “he already achieved his dream”, and this is meant to bring tension between the two trying to paint Tom as the bad guy in this argument but I just thought that sonic is just being a bitch, I can’t even think about why sonic would care since he’s leaving earth, to escape DR. Eggman, but they needed to have some conflict between the two main characters for some reason.</p>
		  <p>The sound design is at least good, the impacts sonic makes with Eggman’s robots, and the sounds used in the bar scene, as for the music, it’s very mediocre, it’s mainly just music that popular right now, yes the music is good but in the end it mainly put in for the sake of sounding relevant, which will only cause it to become dated instead. There’s nothing else I can really say about the music, it’s what you would expect from a film like this, use songs that are popular right now for your sound track.</p>
		  <p>The acting it good at least, it’s fine for the film it doesn’t feel off, it did get a bit cheesy near the end of the film with Tom saying how Sonic is his friend, just felt so off, I’m surprised the actor could say it with a straight face, because I had to curl up from the cringe I felt from the line delivery. I do have to say Jim Carrey did carry this film with his acting, I loved him every time he was on screen, I also enjoyed his assistant, the two worked well off each other in this film.</p>
		  <p>Don’t get me wrong I really did enjoy watching the film is was good for a video game film, but that’s it as a film it’s very middle of the road, but as a video game film it’s one of the best. There are still many problems with the film, the story is boring, the conflict between the main characters is unnecessary and the cause of it feels very patronizing because it’s coming from a million dollar company, Jim Carrey did carry this film for me and if they had gotten someone else to play Eggman I don’t think the film would have been as good. So, overall I thought the film was just alright not great but not bad either, it just feels like a very safe film, it doesn’t try to do anything big or new and it really holds it back from being better, because as it sits now it’s a film people will watch and then forget about. I do hope that if we do get a next film then hopefully the creators will try to do something bigger to make the film more memorable in a good way.</p>
