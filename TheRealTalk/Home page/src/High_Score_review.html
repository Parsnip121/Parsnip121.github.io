		    High Score Review</h3>

		  <p> Video Games. One of if not the largest media industry in the world, with a deep and interesting history, from the first video game made, and the rise and fall of the video game market, before it’s inevitable rise from the ashes. The history of video games is an important one as it can help teach us how this past time has been able to do things like bridge gaps between age and race, give people hope in an otherwise sad situation, or even inspire people to push beyond what others had done with the before. I feel that the Netflix documentary High Score dose an amazing job at telling people about the history of videos games, even if it does tend to jump around a bit on its topics. </p>
		  <p>High Score goes over the history from the Atari all the way up to the rise of FPS (first person shooter) and online gaming. The show not only goes over the common knowledge of this era of gaming like the rise of Mortal Kombat, Doom and Sonic the Hedgehog but also teaches the viewer about some of the lesser known topics such as a dungeon crawler GayBlade made in the 90s during the demonization of the soon to be LGBT community, I had also learnt the creator of the game cartridge, a man by the name of Gerald Anderson Lawson AKA. Jerry Lawson, which I had found very interesting as I had never head of this before. I also enjoyed looking at the topics I already knew about to see if the documentary had any added details I did not know about.</p>
		  <p>The Topics covered by the documentary was well constructed and focusing on different game genres at the time as their own individual episodes made consuming the information easier. My favourite would have to be the episode about RPGs as this is my favourite game genre, and getting to learn about where they got their start and how the genre developed over the years, really fascinated me, and it’s also where I learnt about the game Gayblade, This episode dose also take a small amount of time to talk about the gay and lesbian community in San Francisco, which let me understand what lead to the creation of GayBlade, and how the game helped people struggling through this time. The end of the GayBlade story is with the creator and the community he touched with his game worked together to find the game as the creator lost everything to do with it, while moving.</p>
		  <p>The documentary also went over, the magazine Nintendo power. One thing which I never knew about was Nintendo gameplay counsellor to help people who were stuck on games then you could call them up and they would be able to help you get past any part of Nintendo game you’re stuck on. The documentary really went deep in to this business, and if we’re talking about Nintendo’s history, then I’m happy the documentary covered, the lawsuit between Nintendo and Universal Studios over the copyright infringement on the arcade game Donkey Kong, and John Kirby was able to save Nintendo of America, and win the lawsuit.</p>
		  <p>The sound design, everyone’s speech comes through nice and clear. The man they got to do the voice over, was very nice to listen to, the way he spoke was clear and sounded, knowledgeable on the topics he spoke about. The music isn’t anything outstanding it does its job well to fill in the empty noise, it never overpowers anything but simply compliments the people’s dialogue. I also really enjoyed the 8-bit sound effects, not too much to talk about, it’s nice for them to use 8-bit sound effects rather than using regular sound effects. I loved seeing video game footage being used to break up the still interview shots and the other B-roll footage, I was surprised by some of the games used, it really made me feel like the people behind this were really interested in the history of video games and video games as a whole, as there was footage from some not so well know games, which I loved seeing.</p>
		  <p>The shots used are never too over the top, no crazy camera technics or crazy camera angles. The B-roll footage of the subjects walking around vary from good to why? Such as with one of the subjects who just walks around an empty factory with video game graphics placed around the shots, I like what they did but I just wonder why? Some of the other B-roll footage connects much more with the topic at hand such as having a GameBoy on a table taken apart, as the topic was about the company behind the game StarFox modded a GameBoy to play 3D games. There is footage of old news footage and video game contest footage, this really helped keep the documentary from getting stale with the same shots and same background. During the topic of the video game counsellors, the documentary used little skits of mock introduction videos of what it’s like to be a video game counsellor. I also most forgot to mention about the animated sections all don’t in bit graphics, this really helped to add a nice visual flare to some of the interviewees’ stories.</p>
		  <p>To end off this review, I loved this documentary, from the cuts to footage from other videos some of which were from news channels, some from footage shot at video game competitions and some shot by the crew of the documentary themselves, which really helped to keep the documentary from getting boring, some of the B-roll footage didn’t make much sense such as having of the interviewees walking around an empty factory building, with video game graphics scattered around some of the shots, didn’t feel like it fit the whole grand adventure theme they were going for in the role playing episode. The music dose it’s job of filling in the silence for parts of the documentary, and helps to added substance to parts of the documentary such as with the topic of John Romero, and how he and a friend of his built their work space, and heavy metal music was played. For a video game documentary not very much video game music was used, but this be due in part of licencing, so really the only time you actually hear video game music s mainly when game footage is being shown on screen.</p>
		  <p>The topics covered are some of the well know history that many youtubers has covered before, but I felt that this went more in depth than what the YouTube videos did, but this could be due in part of the documentary being able to actually interview people in the industry and interview those that made games as part of a hobby too. The narration I really did enjoy his voice was clear and calming, making it easy to understand what it was he was saying, I also thought the use of 8-bit sound effects for the animated sections first every nicely as the animation was don’t in bit graphics, it really helped to add clearer context to some of the stories and break-up the monotony of the interview footage.</p>
		  <p>So, I really did enjoy watching this documentary and I hope that it gets some more episodes in the future because I would love to see them cover more recent events with gaming, as not too many people talk about some more of the recent gaming history.</p>
