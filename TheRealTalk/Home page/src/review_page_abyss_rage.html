            <p><a class="text-secondary"> I’ve just recently started using Shonun jump’s new website where you can read many of their catalog for free, called Manga Plus. Now Jump doesn’t have every single chapter for their all their manga, but one of the mangas they had was Abyss rage.</a> </p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><a class="text-secondary">The story for abyss rage, is rather simple, a blind boy named Shinobu, is training to me a martial artist before his girlfriend Mikoto is taken away from him by a stranger that beat his adopted father and himself in a fight. Three years later Shinobu is taken to a prison island where he must fight and kill other prisoners to gain enough points to be let out and save Mikoto. The story was very basic, it wasn’t by any means bad, but ok. That’s pretty much how I can describe, the story never really jumped out at me, I mainly kept reading, because I wanted to know hoe the story end. Once I did finish it, I really couldn’t think of how I felt after reading. I don’t hate the series but I also can’t say I liked it, making this very hard for me to write.</a> </p>
          </blockquote>
<blockquote>
        <p><a class="text-secondary">The artwork is just as ok, as the story and characters, I didn’t notice any bad art work, I didn’t like how the main villain was drawn, but I couldn’t say that any of the manga panels are overly bad.</a> </p>
          </blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><a class="text-secondary">The problem with having to review this series is the fact that I have no strong feelings on either the story or artwork, the real problem with this series will be how forgettable it is, with it having nothing really stands out, that will get people talking about it. Because I can’t put into words my true thoughts on this series I had to make a new rating, the “can’t recommend” rating.</a> </p>
