		    Among Us&nbsp; </h2>
			<p>
			  Firstly, this game came out in 2018, and was on its last legs and the creators were planning on letting it die and move on to the game’s sequel, but recently it blown up, thanks to youtubers playing it. I feel the main reason that this game blew up is mainly because of the quarantine, and many people want games where they can play with their friends, and with the deception, it can be really entertaining for the viewers, but is it fun to be one of the players or is it better to be an observer?

		    Dragon Marked For Death&nbsp; </h2>
			<p>
			  With Dragon Marked for Death or DMFD, the game is split in to two versions on the switch, the frontline fighters which contains the Empress and Warrior and technical attackers which contains the Shinobi and Witch, and with the recent 3.0 update added two new characters the Bandit which is playable after beating the DLC and the Oracle which is playable after beating the game once, as I have only played as the Empress, Warrior, Oracle and Bandit This review will be about these characters.

			  Doom Eternal campaign

			<p>
			  After having to wait through the whole Update 1 situation for Doom eternal, I have finally been able to get my hands-on Doom Eternal for myself, and see what the game is like. Is this a step forward for this new version of Doom or did they screw it up? For this review I will only be talking about the single-player for Doom Eternal as I had no interest in playing online.

			  Have you ever wanted to be the killer in so many of those slasher films, hunting down your victims, toying with them for you own enjoyment? Well Dead by Day light (which I’ll be calling DDL for the rest of this review) is one such game.

		    Persona 4 Golden&nbsp;&nbsp; </h2>
			<p>
			  Another Gem I got during this year’s Steam summer sale, Persona 4 Golden. This has been a game series I’ve been thinking about getting in to but I didn’t want to jump in to buy P5R (persona 5 Royal) as I would have wasted a lot of money for a game, I ended up not liking, so when Atlas released P4G (Persona 4 Golden) for the PC earlier this year I got it, to see if this is a series I could get into, and what I got was a very heartwarming experience that I loved throughout the game, but I did have some hiccups which I’ll go over in this review.

			  Persona 5 Royal
			</h2>
			<p>
			  Persona 5 Royal, has been a very long journey for me, taking me just over 200 hours to beat it, one of the few games that took me over 100 hours to beat, one of the only other games taking me this long is Persona 4 Golden. So, it’s clear that each of the persona games takes a bit of time to complete, but while on this journey I experienced ups and downs along with the characters and worked on building connections, that aided me on this long journey. My word was this a journey, many of my feelings I had for P4G (Persona 4 Golden) still apply for P5R (Persona 5 Royal), and my original opinions for this series has changed a little too.

			  Pokémon Mystery Dungeon Rescue Team DX
			</h2>
			<p>
			  Pokémon Mystery Dungeon Recue team DX is a remake of the original Pokémon Mystery Dungeon red Recue team and blue rescue team, which were released on the Gameboy Advance and Nintendo DS respectively. So, if you loved the originals, then this is a game for you, it’s just as good as the original but with a few additions from the more recent games that I feel make it better than the original. If you’ve never played a Mystery Dungeon game before I’ll tell you why this is a game that well worth it.

			  Resonance of fate/ End of Eternity
			</h2>
			<p>
			  The Steam Summer Sale has come and gone and I was able to get myself a couple of games one of which I have already reviewed, Doom Eternal, this time, which is clear from the title is a game called resonance of fate/End of eternity. I don’t know too much about this game it was something that stood out when compared to many other JRPGs, with it’s more muted colour scheme, the fact that it’s focus is more on guns that swords and magic, and lastly is the world which looks like a steam-punk world, and finally the combat which looked to be more cinematic and not using the turn based system, which I really liked the look of.
