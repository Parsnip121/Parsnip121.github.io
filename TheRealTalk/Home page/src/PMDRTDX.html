		    Pokémon Mystery Dungeon Rescue Team DX review&nbsp; </h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="Bootstrap Image Preview" src="../../../images/banners/Game/pokemon mystery dungeon rescue team dx banner.jpg" width="1040">			
		  <p> Pokémon Mystery Dungeon Recue team DX is a remake of the original Pokémon Mystery Dungeon red Recue team and blue rescue team, which were released on the Gameboy Advance and Nintendo DS respectively. So, if you loved the originals, then this is a game for you, it’s just as good as the original but with a few additions from the more recent games that I feel make it better than the original. If you’ve never played a Mystery Dungeon game before I’ll tell you why this is a game that well worth it. </p>
		  <p>Story, just like with all Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games you a Human that has been turned in to a Pokémon because the world’s balance is in danger and it’s up to you and your new Pokémon Pal to save the world by working as a rescue team. Along the way you’ll encounter new allies, rampaging Pokémon, and fight legendary Pokémon as you try to save the world. Not a deep story but Pokémon games have never really had very deep stories to begin with. Don’t think that once the main story is done that, the game doesn’t have more though, after beating the main story there are more stories to follow that lets you meet many more Pokémon and legendries, plus one character get’s a well deserved resolution, marking the true end to the main story.</p>
		  <p>The gameplay, in mystery dungeon, you enter a mystery dungeon where the layout is different each time. You and your team of three traverse the dungeon fighting other Pokémon, gather items rescuing Pokémon that have been trapped in the dungeon as you work your way towards the end of the dungeon. If you complete all the rescue mission in a single dungeon then the game gives you the option to leave early, this option is also there for each mission completed, but I only took the choice when I completed all the rescue missions. The gameplay is the same throughout the entire game, so don’t expect anything new. I did find a few of the dungeons very tedious to go through, but they’re mainly the 99 floor dungeons, which only become accessible after the main story is beaten. Also all the dungeons are accessible regardless of the Pokémon you have as on the original GBA and DS versions you could only access some of the dungeons if you hade a Pokémon with a specific move on it, which thankfully has been done away with allowing for more team builds than in the original. The difficulty with the game was very low, this is either because I grinded too much or the game was made easier or I understood more than when I played it originally, but I didn’t have any troubles progressing through the game.</p>
		  <p>If you faint in a dungeon then you can send out your own rescue request and other players can go and save you allowing you to continue from where you fainted as well as letting you keep all items on hand. You can opt to be sent back to town and try the whole dungeon again but if you do you loose all items you hand in your bag as well as all the money you hand on you with no way to get it back, but all money left in the bank and items left in the storage are unaffected you only loose the items you take to the dungeon with you.</p>
		  <p>Difficulty, I didn’t have any trouble when playing through the game even in the final dungeon or the post-game dungeons, I don’t know if it’s because I over leveled or if I just had a better understanding of the game’s mechanics but I did have a much easier time playing through this version of the game when compared to the original version, hopefully in the future the Pokémon company can think about adding difficulty settings that would make the game a bit more difficult, as I did get a little board with how easy it was going through.</p>
		  <p>The Visuals, I really like the option to use more of a water coloured look, really suites this game and makes it look like a children’s picture book which just adds to the over amazing visuals of the game. The character models look nice, there’s weren’t any issues I saw during my playthrough of the game, except going through some of the larger dungeons did get a little boring visually, as sometimes there’s not too much happening on floors so it can get a little boring to look at.</p>
		  <p>Music, it’s all remastered versions of the game’s original soundtrack, the music dose it’s job well make tense scenes even more tense, the more up-beat songs bakes fills already joyous scenes with that bit more joy, and you get the idea. None of the tracks I could consider bad just not very memorable, other than the main theme, none of the other songs really stood out to me.</p>
		  <p>Overall, I really enjoyed revisiting the game on the switch along with the changes made, makes this already great game better, the character models looks nice, the dungeon designs fit the theme, it can get a little boring with the visuals but this only really was a problem for me with some of the larger dungeons where it also started to feel repetitive, but this is easily off set by me taking a break from the game and coming back to it later, helped with the feeling of tediousness. The music is great with the remaster of the game’s original sound track. The story is fairly bland and not very engaging, but a few of the storylines after beating the main story are a bit more interesting but, not that much of an improvement. Some of the new cutscenes made for the game do help breath new life in to some of the scenes, along with making everything feel more alive. I did find this game version of the game much easier to beat when compared to the GBA version, it could be because I’m older and I understood the game’s mechanics better it could be that I over leveled or the game was made easier than the original. I really enjoyed my time with the game and I hope we can get some more poleman Mystery Dungeon games, that hopefully are more challenging.</p>
