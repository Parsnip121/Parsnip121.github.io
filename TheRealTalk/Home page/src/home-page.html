						    It’s finally here, one of the most anticipated games ever announced, Final Fantasy 7. Now I never grew up with 7, but I was able to play it on the PS vita after seeing so many people sing it’s praises on the internet.</p>

								The Mandalorian

							<p>
								So, Star Wars hasn’t been doing too well, people don’t like the new main character Rey, people aren’t watching the films, Star Wars Solo no one went to watch and, with EA owning the gaming rights to Star Wars and only Star Wars fallen Order was the only successful Star Wars game. Many people have not been very impressed with how Disney has been handling the Star Wars Franchise, they really needed a show that people would enjoy, and I feel that The Mandalorian is at least a step in the right direction.

		    Among Us&nbsp; </h2>
			<p>
			  Firstly, this game came out in 2018, and was on its last legs and the creators were planning on letting it die and move on to the game’s sequel, but recently it blown up, thanks to youtubers playing it. I feel the main reason that this game blew up is mainly because of the quarantine, and many people want games where they can play with their friends, and with the deception, it can be really entertaining for the viewers, but is it fun to be one of the players or is it better to be an observer?

			<h2>
		    Berserk&nbsp; </h2>
			<p>Berserk is a long running manga series written by a man called Kentaro Miura, and at the time of writing there are 40 volumes, this story dose get new chapters very slowly, there is no definitive reason for why Miura has slowed in his release of chapters, but many fans of berserk likes to say it’s because of Miura’s addiction to the video game Idol Master, there’s no evidence to support this other than Miura himself has admitted, that he is a big fan of the series. Even with the constant hiatuses, this series may still be worth your time, and I hope to convince you it is.&nbsp;</p>

	    <h2> Dragon Marked for Death&nbsp;&nbsp; </h2>
	    <p> With Dragon Marked for Death or DMFD, the game is split in to two versions on the switch, the frontline fighters which contains the Empress and Warrior and technical attackers which contains the Shinobi and Witch, and with the recent 3.0 update added two new characters the Bandit which is playable after beating the DLC and the Oracle which is playable after beating the game once, as I have only played as the Empress, Warrior, Oracle and Bandit This review will be about these characters. </p>

	    <h2> Persona 4 Golden&nbsp; &nbsp; </h2>
	    <p> Another Gem I got during this year’s Steam summer sale, Persona 4 Golden. This has been a game series I’ve been thinking about getting in to but I didn’t want to jump in to buy P5R (persona 5 Royal) as I would have wasted a lot of money for a game, I ended up not liking, so when Atlas released P4G (Persona 4 Golden) for the PC earlier this year I got it, to see if this is a series I could get into, and what I got was a very heartwarming experience that I loved throughout the game, but I did have some hiccups which I’ll go over in this review. </p>

	    <h2> The Rising of the Shield Hero&nbsp;&nbsp; </h2>
	    <p> Warning: This series contains, material that may be upsetting to some viewers. </p>
	    <p>The rising of the shield hero is a series, that makes a slight change to the usual groundwork of an Isakai (a series where the main character is sent to another world, by magic or through reincarnation. The world is usually a Medieval Fantasy world.), usually our main character would be accepted into this new world with open arms, but this series decides to change it up slightly.&nbsp;</p>
