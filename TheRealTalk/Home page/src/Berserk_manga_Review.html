		  <p> Warning: The berserk series is intended for an 18+ audience, if you are under the age of 18, I ask that you do not continue reading this review. Berserk also has scenes of sexual assault and extreme violence, reader discretion is advised. </p>
		  <p>Berserk is a long running manga series written by a man called Kentaro Miura, and at the time of writing there are 40 volumes, this story dose get new chapters very slowly, there is no definitive reason for why Miura has slowed in his release of chapters, but many fans of berserk likes to say it’s because of Miura’s addiction to the video game Idol Master, there’s no evidence to support this other than Miura himself has admitted, that he is a big fan of the series. Even with the constant hiatuses, this series may still be worth your time, and I hope to convince you it is.</p>
		  <p>The story of berserk follows a man named Guts, the story begins in the present with Guts hunting monsters called Apostles, and in these early volumes it’s clear that Guts is not a good guy, he’s willing to do some very underhanded things just to get the upper hand of his enemy. Berserk is a dark Fantasy, with large amounts of extreme Violence., and scenes of sexual assault, so as I put in my warning, if this stuff upsets you then I recommend you don’t pick up this series. If you are a fan of Dark fantasy, then I feel that Berserk is right up your ally, as the violence in the series is great to look at the fights feel impactful.</p>
		  <p>Some of the characters you meet, along gut’s journey are just as enjoyable as Guts, early on in the series you come across a elf named puck, who in the beginning Guts keeps around for no other reason than because the dust that comes from Puck’s wings have healing capabilities. Puck also serves as the series’ comic relief character with references to other series and later on Guts starts journeying with a group, which s few of the fans refer to as the RPG group as many of them fit into a typical RPG party. I am being very vague with who some of the characters are as, I don’t want to spoil much of what goes on as I feel this series is best read when reading it blind. The thing that makes this story as good as it is, is the character development, seeing this slow but realistic change in the characters, over time and even when one goes through radical sudden change it still feel natural to the character.</p>
		  <p>When talking about berserk it can’t be overstated the amazing artwork that Miura has made for this series. The amount of detail he’s put into some of the 2 pages spreads are so beautiful, there a scene from gut’s past where he duels his friend, on a snowy hill and the amount of detail placed into the background is stunning, and some of the more gorier scenes also have been given that level of detail. Speaking of the gore, no matter how much I saw in a panel it never became off putting to me, I feel that the way the art is drawn, it really makes a few of those scenes look just as beautiful as the guts duel.</p>
		  <p>The way the characters are drawn are very detailed, the attention given to the eyes is the best part, such as when Guts lets into his hate and his eyes white over, or when his sanity begins to slip, but Miura not only draws Guts, with looks of pure aggression, but he’s also able to draw Guts with much calmer and softer expressions on his face, like when he’s happy his friends are safe or when, he’s found the one thing he’d been searching for, or when he’s struck by sadness. The expressions given to Guts are some of the best character expressions I’ve ever seen.</p>
		  <p>When it comes to the fights of this series, the way they’re drawn carries a real sense of weight and momentum to them, the impacts feel forceful the way they’re drawn, they all have a sense on momentum. The way Guts is drawn in some of his fights, are so beautiful, I love all the fights, from the way the characters stair each other down, to how their drawn when attacking or deflecting attacks, even their facial expressions helps me to understand what the characters’ thoughts are during the fight.</p>
		  <p>Overall, there is a lot of to this series that warrants giving it a read the characters are great, the relationships that develop feels naturally, and nothing is thrown at you without a good reason. The comedy is nice and doesn’t ruin the feeling of the scenes, some of the references Puck makes can be hard to get, as I even had trouble understanding one of the references in one of the later volumes. Also this series gets updates very slowly, it’s actually become a big joke in the berserk fandom, but even with the large amount of hiatuses, this is still a series that warrants at least a try and at the very most a must read. There isn’t any part of this series that I hate or wish that it never happened, it’s all great and kept me reading, for days on end, the only thing I feel that I can hold against it is the Gore and sexual assault, as this is can make some people not want to read the series, as no one wants to have to read through horrible stuff like that just to experience the story, But for the people that aren’t bothered by it, this is a amazing series.</p>
