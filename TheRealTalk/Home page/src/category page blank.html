		    Berserk&nbsp;&nbsp; </h2>
			<p> Warning: The berserk series is intended for an 18+ audience, if you are under the age of 18, I ask that you do not continue reading this review. Berserk also has scenes of sexual assault and extreme violence, reader discretion is advised. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;Berserk is a long running manga series written by a man called Kentaro Miura, and at the time of writing there are 40 volumes, this story dose get new chapters very slowly, there is no definitive reason for why Miura has&nbsp;slowed in his release of chapters, but many fans of berserk likes to say it’s because of Miura’s addiction to the video game Idol Master, there’s no evidence to support this other than Miura himself has admitted, that he is a big fan of the series. Even with the constant hiatuses, this series may still be worth your time, and I hope to convince you it is.</p>

			  Video Games. A Great sauce of entertainment, from the NES era of gaming where many of the games were about a lives system, but there were also those few games that tried telling an a story even with the limitations, and as time went on games started having bigger and bigger stories the JRPGs of the Super Nintendo era, the first 3D action games of the late 90s all the way to now where people have started claiming video games as works of art for trying to push boundaries and telling amazing and interesting stories.
