		    Final Fantasy 7 Remake&nbsp; </h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="Bootstrap Image Preview" src="../../../images/banners/Game/FF7remakebanner.jpg" width="900">			
		  <p> It’s finally here, one of the most anticipated games ever announced, Final Fantasy 7. Now I never grew up with 7, but I was able to play it on the PS vita after seeing so many people sing it’s praises on the internet, and I fell in love with it. Everything from the materia system and battle system to the characters and story, so back when 7 remake was first announced I was over joyed, that many more people will get the chance to experience this story, but after playing the remake, it’s not it makes itself out to be. </p>
		  <p>Gameplay for final Fantasy 7 remake, takes the old active battle system and changes it up, by making FF7 remake an action game with turn based elements. Now that may sound odd but I’ll do my best to explain. While in combat the player has full control over their character, able to move around the battle freely, along with the ability to block and even counter depending on the character as well as do a dodge move, when using a character’s basic attack on the enemy as well as when time passes in battle the characters build the ATB meter to a max of two segments, and you spend the ATB meter to cast spells, use items or do a special attack. When bringing up the command menu, the game slows to a pause allowing the player time to select the command they want.</p>
		  <p>Each of the playable characters also have their own unique skill, Cloud’s is he has two stances, one allows for fast movement around the field and do average damage called operative mode and his second stance which slows Cloud, but dose more damage than the first stance, it also replaces your block with a count that only activates when hit by a melee attack. Weapons also each have a skill that can be used across all weapons once it has been mastered on the weapon it’s tied to.</p>
		  <p>The battle system is great, it’s enjoyable and feels like a natural evolution of the original battle system from the original Final Fantasy 7, but there are some elements that I feel don’t work well. Part way through the game you unlock some arenas to fight in, and some require using just one character, and not all of the party members can fight well on their own, so I ended up dying a lot trying to do their challenges. There are some enemies that I found annoying during my time in the game, one noteworthy is an enemy that acted like a whack-a-mole, making it more annoying to fight as you are forced to chase it around the battle hoping it sits still long enough to hit it, but other than that one enemy, the rest of the enemies were enjoyable to.</p>
		  <p>For the fans of the Materia system from the original FF7, I’m happy to say that it’s here in the remake but is toned down, so materia levels up with AP obtained in battle and different materia affects your character states differently, but like I said it’s toned down so don’t expect any crazy materia combos in this game, at most you can combine a new materia along with a elemental spell to give your weapon that elemental damage, I’m sure there are some more materia combos, but during my playthrough I never really needed any of the materia combos.</p>
		  <p>A new system added in the remake, is the ability to upgrade weapons, with each level up or by obtaining indexes, the player gains SP, points used in unlocking spheres improving specific aspects of each weapon, physical damage, magical damage, both physical and magical defense, and a few skills as well.</p>
		  <p>The overall difficulty of the game, was pretty easy, I did struggle with one or two bosses, but that was mainly because I didn’t understand their gimmick when fighting them, or I made a mistake and selected the wrong option from the menu at a crucial moment. No matter what level I reached even after reaching max level, the game continued to challenge me, this is because the enemies scale with your characters throughout the game. After beating the game, both EXP and AP gain is increased making it easier to max out your character’s level, and level up materia.</p>
		  <p>The game dose have a hard mode that’s unlocked after beating the game, which gives players a new level of challenge, where items can’t be used and only HP is restored at the game’s rest points rather than bop HP and MP, I’ve only had a little time in hard mode, but if you want a real challenge, then Hard mode is where it’s at. The game also has arenas for the player to test their skills in and to earn rewards, apart from the arena challenges that required me to play on hard mode, I really liked each of the challenges, and the rewards felt very rewarding.</p>
		  <p>During your playthrough you will be given and completing tasks for a new character to the remake called Chadley, and it’s from him where you will be getting almost all of your summons from, as by completing each of his tasks you’ll eventually unlock VR challenges, where you much fight and defeat the summon before you can get it’s materia.</p>
		  <p>Now the hardest part, the story. FF7 remakes follows the events of the original FF7, with slight changes to the story here and there but mainly follows the big events of the original story. This game dose only covers the Midgard section of the original FF7 but don’t think that this game doesn’t have content, some of the quicker moments have been expanded upon, such as your time in the sector 7 slums, when you reach here there are multiple side quests to do before moving on to the main story. Characters that never got much characterization in the original are more flushed out here and it even introduces some new characters to the story too. Some plot details are added sooner such as the hooded men, and more events where cloud is affected by his past and the events that lead him to his current life. Sephiroth also appears more often during this time in flash backs as well as hallucinations caused by Clouds past.</p>
		  <p>The game is very linier in its story, there are parts of the game where you’re given small sections of the game to freely explore before, continuing with there story, where side mission can be obtained and completed, these were nice and gave me a little bit of time to breath before continuing with the story. For the side mission I found quite a few of them enjoyable and easy, and for the ones I didn’t enjoy as much I was still able to get through them relatively easily, there was one mission which required me to get music tracks and to play them on a jukebox, there wasn’t any indication on where I may find the specific tracks, and I ended up looking it up online, as I could not find the specific tracks needed for the mission.</p>
		  <p>When going back and replaying some of the chapters, I would of liked the ability to pick specific parts of a chapter, as on the route back to Sector 7 there is a puzzle area you have to get through using giant robot hands, and I would of liked to of skipped this sections of the chapter as it’s not an area I want to go through another time, just to take part in the arena for a specific item</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;The soundtrack for this game, takes all of the original tracks and remakes them, so you’ll hear ready to fight, when battling during the first bombing mission of the game, there’s the remakes of the sector 7 slums and Aerith’s theme. It is possible to hear some of the original tracks, as throughout the game, the original tracks can be heard, and can be obtained from either a shop or an NPC nearby, and can then be played at any jukebox that can be found in-game.</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;The sound effects are spot on, there’s not a single thing with the sound quality that I hated or even disliked, the same can be said for the English voice acting, each of the actors played their characters well, each actor’s voice fit their voices well, and I really enjoyed the delivery Don Corneo, he sounds exactly how I expected him to sound.</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;Overall, I loved this game and I’m looking forward to seeing where this series goes. I loved almost everything about this game the music was outstanding, with each of the remade songs sound amazing and new while still have the core of the song intact, the combat was enjoyable and a great new way to take the ATB system of the original and evolve it to the battle system used in this game, the inclusion of some new mechanics such as the weapon upgrades, the story and, voice actors did a great job with their line deliveries. The game has gotten cheaper since it’s release so if you want a good RPG to play, even if you haven’t played the original it’s still worth playing, and I can’t wait to get more from this new version of Final Fantasy 7.</p>
