			<h3>
		    Dragon’s Dogma Anime&nbsp; </h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="Bootstrap Image Preview" src="../../../images/banners/Film TV/ddbanner.jpg" width="1040">			
		  <p> When I first heard about the game Dragon’s dogma is getting it’s own animated series, I expected it to follow the game’s story, and for it to explain a lot about it’s world and how it works, but instead it ended up being entirely different from the story told in the game, which I’m fine with, I just would of liked to of been able to understand more of the world, and it’s laws that govern it. </p>
		  <p>The story for Dragon’s Dogma follows Ethen as his village is destroyed by a dragon, which also results in the death of his wife, their unborn child and a second child which the two knew. Once Ethen is the last survivor, the dragon proceeds to take Ethan’s heart turning him in to an Arisen. Arisen’s are fated to fight against the dragon, so accompanied by his new companion, a being known as a pawn, they travel the land in search of the dragon.</p>
		  <p>Dragon’s Dogma is a short series, just 7 episodes long, and that’s because each episode focuses on one of the seven deadly sins, I liked the approach the series took at presenting some of the sins, in humanity, but two of the episodes I thought was really stupid, because of how some of the characters acted. Aside from the episodes Envy and Greed, I thought the rest of the episodes were good, nothing too outstanding, the overall story left a lot to be desired. I had hoped that this series would have helped to fill out the world but, it never really deviated from its main story of tracking down the dragon.</p>
		  <p>The story did use small moments to go over the story of how Ethan met his wife, these never really got in the way of the story due to the fact that each of them were short, but they did come up is odd places in the story, that confused me a little, but not enough to make me loose track of what was happening in the plot.</p>
		  <p>The sound work isn’t anything special, it all sounds very nice, but I couldn’t tell you what any of the songs were, as they are very forgettable. I need to state that the music wasn’t bad, by no means would I say that it’s bad, but it just never felt very original, it was too generic for it to really stand out.</p>
		  <p>The sound work is very well made, the sound of the weapons clashing isn’t stupid or ear piercing, all the other sounds effects, all works well, the moving of rubble sound nice and is lined up perfectly with the shots. The voice acting for the English Dub was very well made, all the voices lined up with the lip movements nicely, plus each of the actors fit their roles really well, and neither did any of the voices feel like that didn’t fit the characters, I really did enjoy the voice acting for this show.</p>
		  <p>The visuals will be something that won’t sit well with everyone. As instead for going for hand drawn, which many anime use, this show uses 3D models, which I know doesn’t sit well many people, and I understand, but I personally really like the 3D models, the way they move is a little stiff, mainly because they’re not moving at 60 frames or even 30 frames. The models, are all well designed, and I especially like their designs of their clothing, and armor designs, the armor dose stand out which helps make the characters stand out more from the environments, and makes each of them more memorable.</p>
		  <p>Overall I liked the series, it is on the short side for my taste, and leaves me with lots of questions, I hope that we get more from this series, because I thought it was very nicely done, the sound work was on point, nothing to pull me out of the scenes or ear grating. The story was a bit of a miss for me in some of the episodes and I felt didn’t flush out the world enough and left me with answers that I hoping that the show would answer. The visuals are good, and the over animation is nice even if the show uses 3D models rather than hand drawn animation. There wasn’t really much I could say about this show as for one it’s a short series and two, it was a average show, it didn’t really do anything outstanding, but it wasn’t really bad in anyway.</p>
