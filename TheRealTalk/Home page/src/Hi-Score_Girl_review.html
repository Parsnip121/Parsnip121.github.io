		  <h3>Hi-Score Girl Review</h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img alt="Bootstrap Image Preview" src="../../../images/banners/Film TV/hiscoregirlbanner.jpg" width="1040">			
		  <p> I’ve recently finished this anime on Netflix that goes by the name Hi-Score Girl. Hi-Score girl is an anime that has recently received it’s second season and is adapted from the original manga (A Japanese comic that reads from right to left even for the translation and typically do not colour in their panels) of the same name The thing that first pulled me in was the setting, the anime begins place in 1991 up to the late-90s , around the time arcades were really starting to take off, thanks largely in part to 2D fighting game, the story follows a young gamer growing up during this time named, Haruo Yaguchi as he forms an uncanny rivalry with the most popular girl in his class Akira Ono, who keeps her gaming habits secret, as time passes new characters get introduced such as secondary girl Koharu Hidaka. </p>
		  <p>The writing for the story has a fare few clichés such as the character of Ono being a tsundere (a character that is typically very aggressive towards the main character as a way to handle their affections towards them) along with the main character not being the brightest of characters, this did put me off a little with the show as I could never like the tsundere character, but sticking with it I could tell that the character dose know quite a bit about video games using terms such a Guile turtling (a tactic where someone who plays Guile holds and away from their opponent allowing for both offense and defence which is rather difficult to beat), there’s the players mindset and goes in to who they play and how they play that character, the games that are made while also talking about console gaming too, it clear from this and more that the writer know what they are talking about more than man about fighting games as well as some console games too. In season 2 of Hi-score girl the games do start to take a back seat and are used as more a way for the characters to resolve conflicts as well as a way for them to connect too. The story also begins becoming more and more of a romance as both season one and season two go on.</p>
		  <p>For the animation, it uses 3D models for it’s characters which many fans of anime may be disheartened over but with the faces being hand drawn on to the models this still allows the characters to have their overly expressive faces for comedic effect, the anime also uses a lot of pixel art for when the in game characters talk to the characters in their heads, but for these pixel art characters most of the time the animators just use what can be found in the games and don’t really animate anything new for them. Seeing the characters describe some of their situations to video games I felt was nice as I felt like I could understand some of what they were feeling better by the sort of games they described the situations with, and seeing small clips from the can or some of the game’s sprites litter the world allowed for me to see the world from the characters perspective better than just saying how they’re feeling. There’s never really a moment animation where I feel that it’s off or the quality dips anywhere, the over the top reactions and movements never look odd, the camera placements and movants are kept very simple which I feel works for this type of show, there are moments where the animators do move the camera a lot but it’s usually for dramatic moments and doesn’t make the viewer loose track of what’s going on in the shot.</p>
		  <p>As for the English voice actors they all do a good job on their deliveries there’s not really any point in the show where I feel that they could of improved their performance, all the voices felt right for the characters they were playing no one felt mis-cast for their roles, the audio was nice and punchy when needed, the music is a little forgettable other than the opening and ending music none of the other tracks really stand out to me.</p>
		  <p>Over all this is a very good show with likable characters a well written story even if some of the characters do fall in to some of the cliché models that have been common place for years now in anime, none of them got annoying, nor dislikeable.</p>
