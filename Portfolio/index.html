				    Persona 5 Royal&nbsp; </h3>
					<img class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9" src="../images/review banners/persona 5 royal banner.jpg" />
					<p> Persona 5 Royal, has been a very long journey for me, taking me just over 200 hours to beat it, one of the few games that took me over 100 hours to beat, one of the only other games taking me this long is Persona 4 Golden. So, it’s clear that each of the persona games takes a bit of time to complete, but while on this journey I experienced ups and downs along with the characters and worked on building connections, that aided me on this long journey. My word was this a journey, many of my feelings I had for P4G (Persona 4 Golden) still apply for P5R (Persona 5 Royal), and my original opinions for this series has changed a little too. </p>

					<h3>
				    High Score&nbsp; </h3>
					<img class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9" src="../images/review banners/High Score banner.jpg" />

					<p>
					  Video Games. One of if not the largest media industry in the world, with a deep and interesting history, from the first video game made, and the rise and fall of the video game market, before it’s inevitable rise from the ashes. The history of video games is an important one as it can help teach us how this past time has been able to do things like bridge gaps between age and race, give people hope in an otherwise sad situation, or even inspire people to push beyond what others had done with the before. I feel that the Netflix documentary High Score dose an amazing job at telling people about the history of videos games, even if it does tend to jump around a bit on its topics.

					<h3>
				    Berserk&nbsp; </h3>
					<img class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9" src="../images/review banners/Berserkbanner.png" />

					<p> Warning: The berserk series is intended for an 18+ audience, if you are under the age of 18, I ask that you do not continue reading this review. Berserk also has scenes of sexual assault and extreme violence, reader discretion is advised. </p>
					<p>&nbsp;Berserk is a long running manga series written by a man called Kentaro Miura, and at the time of writing there are 40 volumes, this story dose get new chapters very slowly, there is no definitive reason for why Miura has slowed in his release of chapters, but many fans of berserk likes to say it’s because of Miura’s addiction to the video game Idol Master, there’s no evidence to support this other than Miura himself has admitted, that he is a big fan of the series. Even with the constant hiatuses, this series may still be worth your time, and I hope to convince you it is.</p>
