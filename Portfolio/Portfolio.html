          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the rise of Web2.0 the internet has become the number one way for people to communicate with each other, where originally if you wanted to talk to someone you would have to use the home phone or sending letter, which limits you to people you now, but with the Internet you can talk to people who live on the other side of the world, make new friends and find communities that share the same interests as you “<a href="https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/internet-changed-everyday-life/">The Internet frees us from geographic fetters and brings us together in topic-based communities</a>” (Dentzel, Zaryn. Madrid: BBVA. 2013.) The internet has also revolutionised how we get information, where before the internet you would have to go to your locale shop and buy your local newspaper if you wanted to know what had happened the day before, but now with the rise of the internet it’s much easier to get the news quicker, with updates being uploaded up to a minute after they happen. “<a href="https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/internet-changed-everyday-life/">if you wanted to keep up with the news, you had to walk down to the newsstand when it opened in the morning and buy a local edition reporting what had happened the previous day</a>” (Dentzel, Zaryn. Madrid: BBVA. 2013.) </p>
			<p>For this Module, I will be making a review site revolving around entertainment, specifically reviews for Games, Films, TV shows as well as, Books, the reason I chose to do a review site is because I have played many games seen many films and TV shows and read quite a few books, and I wanted to share my options on different pieces of work. My Target Audience will be people aged 16-25 years old as this is a suitable age range for people to start looking up information on entertainment before buying it or investing time in to it, I looked at the Nintendo Life web design and layout and Liked how they organized it, with the most recent posts, being at the very top of the home page, the site having a tab in the menus dedicated to specific posts such as a tag for games and a tag for gaming news.</p>
	<p>I am an aspiring Film Director, I have experiance in editing video and audio, Camera operation as well as wescript writing. I have been writing reviews for my own site for almost 1 year now.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

				    Persona 5 Royal&nbsp; </h3>
					<img class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9" src="../images/banners/Game/persona5royalbanner.jpg" />
					<p> Persona 5 Royal, has been a very long journey for me, taking me just over 200 hours to beat it, one of the few games that took me over 100 hours to beat, one of the only other games taking me this long is Persona 4 Golden. So, it’s clear that each of the persona games takes a bit of time to complete, but while on this journey I experienced ups and downs along with the characters and worked on building connections, that aided me on this long journey. My word was this a journey, many of my feelings I had for P4G (Persona 4 Golden) still apply for P5R (Persona 5 Royal), and my original opinions for this series has changed a little too. </p>

				    High Score&nbsp; </h3>
					<img class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9" src="../images/banners/Film TV/hiscoregirlbanner.jpg" />

					<p>
					  Video Games. One of if not the largest media industry in the world, with a deep and interesting history, from the first video game made, and the rise and fall of the video game market, before it’s inevitable rise from the ashes. The history of video games is an important one as it can help teach us how this past time has been able to do things like bridge gaps between age and race, give people hope in an otherwise sad situation, or even inspire people to push beyond what others had done with the before. I feel that the Netflix documentary High Score dose an amazing job at telling people about the history of videos games, even if it does tend to jump around a bit on its topics.

					<h3>
				    Berserk&nbsp; </h3>
					<img class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9" src="../images/banners/Book/Berserkbanner.png" />

					<p> Warning: The berserk series is intended for an 18+ audience, if you are under the age of 18, I ask that you do not continue reading this review. Berserk also has scenes of sexual assault and extreme violence, reader discretion is advised. </p>
					<p>&nbsp;Berserk is a long running manga series written by a man called Kentaro Miura, and at the time of writing there are 40 volumes, this story dose get new chapters very slowly, there is no definitive reason for why Miura has slowed in his release of chapters, but many fans of berserk likes to say it’s because of Miura’s addiction to the video game Idol Master, there’s no evidence to support this other than Miura himself has admitted, that he is a big fan of the series. Even with the constant hiatuses, this series may still be worth your time, and I hope to convince you it is.</p>
